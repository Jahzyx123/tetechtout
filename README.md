# NEON FORGE

Suno 5.5 prompt lab — techno-focused, but fluent in everything else.
Rebuilt from the legacy 600 KB single-file app into plain ES modules with
**zero install and no bundler**: any static file server runs it.

```
python3 -m http.server 8080      # then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Layout

```
index.html          thin shell (loads ui/app.js as an ES module)
data/               ~100 content pools, extracted VERBATIM from the legacy app
engine/             pure logic — no DOM anywhere
ui/                 minimal DOM layer (app shell + manual-pick modal)
tools/              extraction + optional single-file build
tests/              headless test suite (node, jsdom optional)
Tetech-main/        original app — the data source for extraction (read-only)
tools/legacy/       legacy build/engine/smoke scripts kept for reference
```

### /data — generated, verbatim

Every `const NAME = […]` pool (STYLES, GENRES, TEMPO_RULES, FEELINGS, LEADS,
KICKS, all TECHNO_*, all SPARK_*, ATOMS, PICKER_POOLS, SAFETY_LINE, …) is
pulled programmatically out of `Tetech-main/index.html` by
`node tools/extract-data.js`, using the JS-aware `extractConst()` scanner and
the deterministic pool expansion from the legacy build — the content is never
re-typed. Don't hand-edit these files; re-run the extractor.

### /engine — ported algorithms

* `prng.js` — `mulberry32` seeded PRNG + `pick()`; deterministic per seed.
* `genre.js` — weirdness slider (3-point core/sub/rare interpolation),
  "Sub-Style Genre" combo naming with the 8-retry no-repeat rule,
  `tempoForGenre()` (genre-aware BPM / weighted techno bands).
* `world.js` — electronic/organic/hybrid classification + `genreSafeText()`
  regex rewriting (four-on-the-floor → steady pulse, 909/303/rave stripping,
  style names protected via placeholder swap).
* `prompt.js` — `assemble()`/`sanitize()` block system: Style Prompt hard-capped
  at **1000 chars**, Full Brief at **3000 chars**; compact-first, then drop by
  priority, then clause-boundary clamp — never mid-word. Includes the
  instrumental vocal sanitizer and the banned max-energy word list.
* `roll.js` — **one** roll engine: `roll(state, scope, {mode, tries})`.
  Scope = field / section / everything; mode = `random` or `max`
  (maximize score over N tries). This replaces the legacy Idea Engine,
  MORE MAGIC, MEGA BATCH, Anthem Builder and Genetic/Quantum Labs.
* `share.js` — state ↔ URL-safe base64 (`?s=…` share links).

### Modes

* **Techno-Only** — rolls from the 838-style techno pool, weighted BPM bands.
* **No-Techno** — rolls genre + sub-style combos from the 250+/2800+ pool,
  genre-aware tempo, style-fit auto-curation and genre-safe rephrasing.

Both are first-class; the mode toggle sits in the header.

## Commands

```
npm start            # static server (or any other file server)
npm test             # node tests/run.js — 140 checks, jsdom part optional
npm run extract      # regenerate /data from Tetech-main/index.html
npm run build        # optional single-file dist/index.html for sharing
```

`npm i` is only needed for the jsdom UI-boot test; the app itself has no
dependencies.

### Note on file sizes

Every source module stays well under 150 KB (largest: `data/styles.js`,
~74 KB). The optional `dist/index.html` is ~440 KB **by design** — it embeds
all ~347 KB of verbatim pool data into one shareable file. The runtime app is
the modular tree, not the dist file.
